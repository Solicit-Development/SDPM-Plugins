# BurgerCustomArmor
Have you ever seen a server where wearing a certain piece of armor will provide you with cool effects? With this plugin, you can make unique armor sets with a variety of abilities! Your server can advance PvP thanks to a broad variety of powers that you may bestow on armor sets and a ton more that are on the way! When wearing ALL FOUR items from the armor set — the helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots — players will acquire all the abilities mentioned on the armor.

## Ideas for Server Owners
- Tiered Kit System using leather armor, with the color getting progressively darker as the kit gets stronger
- Event based sets, receive items of the set for winning special events like KOTH, Boss Battle, etc
- Create a class system of different sets, with say an Archer set having high damage when using bows but very low defense
- Have fun and mess around
